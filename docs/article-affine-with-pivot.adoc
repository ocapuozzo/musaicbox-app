== Abstract


This article addresses a topic related to musical set theory, and particularly to basic operations: inversion, transformation by cycles of fifths and fourths (M7 and M5).

It demonstrates the need to be able to choose the axis, or more precisely the pivot point around which the transformations are applied, in order to overcome the negative influence of pitch zero in these operations.

The solution proposed here takes David Lewin's idea for inversion (I^u^) and generalizes it to the other M5 and M7 transformations.

Finally, the extended affine function has a new parameter, but remains fully compatible with current usage, through a logic that automatically assigns a default pivot value, similar to the "moveable-DO" system.

The code for the affine function with pivot is provided (TypeScript).

== Usual operations

In context of twelve-tone equal temperament, more specialy in pitch-class space, we note stem:[ZZ_12] the set stem:[ZZ"/"12ZZ]

stem:[ ZZ_12 = {bar0, bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4, bar5, bar6, bar7, bar8, bar9, bar10, bar11}]

Each element stem:[i] of stem:[ZZ_12] is representative of a class of numbers multiple of 12. For example, stem:[i = bar1] is representative of positive numbers {1, 13, 25, 37, ...} (stem:[i + 12q]) and negative numbers {1, -11, -23, -35, ...} (stem:[i - 12q])

=== Modulo operation

By convention, stem:[ZZ_n] is represented by the set of first positive numbers (starting with zero) and often the bare notation above is omitted.

Modulo is an operation that reduces any number in stem:[ZZ] to its representative number.

The 12-hour clock is a good example. 13h is mapped to 1h, midnight  -1h to 11H.

The logic of modulo numbers from stem:[ZZ] to stem:[ZZ_(n)] representative numbers is: stem:[i |->  i - n xx floor(i/n)], with stem:[n>0], consistent <<Knuth>> version <<modulo>>.


TIP: stem:[floor(x)]: This symbol denotes floored of stem:[x], the largest integer less than or equal to stem:[x]. +
Ex : stem:[floor(0.99) |-> 0] and stem:[floor(1.01) |-> 1] (the integer part)

In our case, stem:[floor(i/n)] gives the line number above and below the reference pitch-class representative line below.

Some illustrative cases:

* 25 modulo 12 = *1* +
stem:[25 - n xx lfloor 25/n rfloor] = 25 - 12 × Math.floor(25/12) = 25 - (12 × 2) = *1*
* 13 modulo 12 = *1*  {nbsp}(13 - 12*1)

* -11 modulo 12 = *1* {nbsp}(-11 + 12*1)
* -13 modulo 12 = *11* {nbsp}(-13 + 12*2) +
stem:[-13 - n xx lfloor (-13)/n rfloor] = -13 - 12 × Math.floor(-13/12) = -13 + (-12 × -2) = -13 + 24 = *11*

=== Basic operations

In musical set theory, into context of twelve-tone equal temperament (n=12), the basic operations are generally represented by ( <<Rahn>> <<Fripertinger>> <<Moreno-Argon>>, among others):

* *Transposition* : stem:[T_k : ZZ xx ZZ_12 → ZZ_12 , x |-> T_k(x) := x + k]
* *Inversion* : stem:[I : ZZ_12 → ZZ_12 , x |-> I(x) := -x]
* *Cycle transformation*:
** Cycle fourth transformation : stem:[M_5 : ZZ_12 → ZZ_12 , x |->  M_5(x) := 5x]
** Cycle fifths transformation : stem:[M_7 : ZZ_12 → ZZ_12 , x |->  M_7(x) := 7x]

If we look carefully, we have a multiplication (inversion as stem:[-1x], stem:[M_5] and stem:[M_7]) and one addition (transposition).

We can combine these operations in the form of an affine operation, _ax + b_, of _Z~n~_ into _Z~n~_

== Conclusion

After observing the so-called "fixed zero" problem, we propose a general solution to the affine function.

To this end, we introduced a new parameter to the affine function acting on PCS to improve its consistency, particularly with respect to inversion (M11) and transformation by cycles of fifths and fourths (M5 and M7).

The general form of the function, without complementarity, is `M~p~aTk` (or `TkM~p~a` in equivalent <<Rahn>> notation).

The concept of a default value for the pivot has been introduced, allowing the parameterized affine function to substitute for the usual affine function. The form of this new operation is `MaTk` (or `[C]MaTk` with complementarity). This provides general consistency, and allows and thus to blend into existing frameworks and allows the latter to increase their accuracy by specifying, as needed, an adequate pivot value.
