This document presents the main concepts illustrated on the https://88musaics.org[88musaics.org] site, plus others (modes and scales). The implementation chosen for this application are detailed, and certain concepts from Musial Set Theory are discussed.

== Introduction

Aim of this study is to highlight relationship (morphism) between logic spatial and sound structures.

Timbre, expression, duration, function... Everything that makes music touch us is not part of this study.

=== For which audience ?

Artists are looking for new "muses", based on a neutral and scientific approachfootnote:[provided that they accept the postulate of the decomposition of an octave into 12 equal parts.].

== PCS

=== Abstraction

Abstraction is a description of a reality.

The person who abstracts, reduces reality, or what he perceives as reality, into something smaller.

=== Orbit
Orbit is, finally, another term to describe an abstraction class.
Elements of orbit share same characteristics of orbit.
Example : Orbit cyclic of major chord `{ C,E,G }` characterised by interval structure  `IS:(4,3,5)`  is composed of 12 elements (`{ C, E, G }, { C#, E#, G# }, ..., { B, D#, F# }`)

== Equivalence relations

This is a link that brings together different elements under one same roof, same orbit, same abstraction.


=== Octave equivalence

Reduce to 12 pitch classes and its 4096 PCS (2^12)

=== Intervallic structure equivalence

Reduce to 352 orbits


=== Dihedral equivalence

=== Affine equivalence

=== Musaic equivalence
