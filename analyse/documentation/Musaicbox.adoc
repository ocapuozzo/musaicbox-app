This project is a POC for main concepts illustrated on the https://88musaics.org[88musaics.org] site, plus others (modes, scales, chords...). The implementation chosen for this application are detailed, and certain concepts from Musial Set Theory are discussed.

== Introduction

Aim of this software is to highlight relationship (morphism) between logic spatial and sound structures.

The only sound will be product are there generate by user on his instruments :)

=== For which audience ?

Musicians are looking for new "muses", based on a neutral and scientific approach.footnote:[provided that they accept the postulate of the decomposition of an octave into 12 equal parts.]

=== Use Case

4 entries (4 pages)

* PCS page (with Undo/Redo.footnote:[redo:return to future if past is not updated])
====
Useful form one PCS, explore modes, possible chords and other PCS in geometrical relationship, but not else.
====

* ZnExplorer page
====
Explore orbits resulting of various group action.

A good illustration of mathematics concepts.

Example : Get Limited Transposition PCS in Cyclic Prime Form : Select only `M1` operation and click on button with label :  _Show orbits (352) grouped by Stabilizers signature_. On 352 PCS representatives, 335 are 12 uniques transposed, 17 are less than 12 (called PCS in Limited Transposition)

====

* 88 musaics page
====

Explore musaics shearing same meta-stabilizers.footnote:[A stabiliser is a transformation operation which conserve structure] (meta for "up to transposition")

Example : There is 6 musaics which are invariant by complement operation (a stabilizer) : Select only `CM1` operation (C for _complement_ M1 for _neutral multiplication operation_)

Push selection musaics to "Whiteboard" page (right click), or explore one musaic into "PCS" page.

====

* white board page (with Undo/Redo.footnote:[redo:return to future if past is not updated] and Copy/Cut/Paste)
====

Organize PCS in various representations on 2D surface.

Give to musician possibility to add text, arrange PCS (selection multiple, position, representation, zoom,...), save content page into file and restore content from local file.

== PCS

=== Abstraction

Abstraction is a description of a reality.

The person who abstracts, reduces reality, or what he perceives as reality, into something smaller.

=== Orbit
Orbit is, finally, another term to describe an abstraction class.
Elements of orbit share same characteristics of orbit.
Example : Orbit cyclic of major chord `{ C,E,G }` characterised by interval structure  `IS:(4,3,5)`  is composed of 12 elements (`{ C, E, G }, { C#, E#, G# }, ..., { B, D#, F# }`)

== Equivalence relations

This is a link that brings together different elements under one same roof, same orbit, same abstraction.


=== Octave equivalence

Reduce to 12 pitch classes and its 4096 PCS (2^12)

=== Intervallic structure equivalence

Reduce to 352 orbits


=== Dihedral equivalence

=== Affine equivalence

=== Musaic equivalence

== Prime Form

=== What Prime Form is
=== What Prime Form is not


=== Modal prime form
