Musaicbox application is intended to be a POC for main concepts defined and illustrated on https://88musaics.org[88musaics.org] site, plus others (modes, scales, chords...). The implementation chosen for this application are detailed, and some concepts from Musical Set Theory are discussed.

== Introduction

The idea behind this application is to offer the user a UI/UX to concretely manipulate abstract concepts, highlight relationship (morphism) between logic spatial and sound structures (_Pitch Class Set_) .

We hope that user will make use of this tool in his composition and instrumental practice activities.

=== For which audience ?

Musician eager to add to his source of inspiration a muse of a scientific nature, based on idea of reducing any combination of sounds to a set of pitch classes, called _pitch class set_ (PCS).footnote:[provided that they accept the postulate of the decomposition of an octave into 12 "equal parts".]

=== Use Cases

4 entries (four main pages)

== PCS

=== Pitch Class Abstraction

In equal-tempered music, any musical fragment can be reduced to a combination of pitch classes, whether that fragment is melodic (horizontal) or harmonic (vertical).

* Equivalence of pitch classes

image:equiv-pc.png[equiv pitch class]

* Enharmonic equivalence

image:equiv-enhar.png[equiv enharmonic]

* Without reference to rythme

image:equic-repet.png[equiv]

* Insensitive to the order and repetitions of notes within the fragment, whether melodic or harmonic...

image:equiv-hv.png[equiv pitch class]

If we make the pitch class of C correspond to the class modulo 12 named stem:[bar 0], pitch class C# by stem:[bar 1] , … , and so on up to B by the pitch class number stem:[bar 11].

* stem:[bar 0] represents all C's, and their enharmonics (B#, Dbb, ...) all octaves combined.

* stem:[bar 1] represents all C#'s, and their enharmonics (B##, Db, ...) in any octave.

etc.

The resulting set of pitch classes is: stem:[Z//12Z] or stem:[Z_12]

stem:[Z_12 = {bar 0, bar 1, bar 2, bar 3, bar 4, bar 5, bar 6, bar 7, bar 8, bar 9, bar 10, bar 11 } ]

[NOTE]
====
It is customary, *for convenience*, *not* to use the barred notation, i.e.  stem:[0] instead of {nbsp} stem:[bar 0]

=> This way of doing things will have unsuspected repercussion... this problem is studied later in this document.
====

We can easily establish a correspondence between the set of integers modulo 12 and the set of pitch classes name (without bar).

This is the logic established by the Musical Set Theory and its great authors such as <<Forte>> and <<Rahn>>.

So, there are *12 pitch classes*, numerical represented  by integers from 0 to 11footnote:[Sometimes 10 and 11 are noted A, B or e, t].

image::cicrleFullV2.png[]

=== Enumeration

With set of 12 elements stem:[E = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}]

The set of all subsets of stem:[E] is called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set[powerset], denoted stem:[P(E)], and has stem:[2^12] = 4096 elements (subsets).

In the context of Musical Set Theory, a subset, element of stem:[P(E)], is called *PCS*, for _Pitch Class Set_.

Is there 2^12^ = *4096 pcs*, from empty set `{}` to ful set `{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}` passing by all possible ordered pcs configurations as `{}`, `{0}`, `{1}`, ..., `{0,4,7}`, `{1,5,7}`,... , etc

4096 pcs can be ordered by their number of pitch classes (cardinality).

* Empty set : 1 pcs (with no pitch class)
* Monad set : 12 pcs (seen in the circle)
* Dyad set  : 66 pcs
* Triad     : 220 pcs (among them, the 12 major triads)
* ...
* Full set : 1 pcs (chromatic set)

Their distribution by cardinality is given by line 12 of Pascal's triangle below.

.Pascal's triangle
image::pascal-triangle-12.png[pascal-triangle-12,width=50%,height=50%]

This classification is not very practical for us, because it is semantically poor (based on the cardinality of PCS).

One of the major goals of the application is to refine the
classifications.

But before that, it seems useful to focus on the different representations of a PCS.

== PCS Representations

A _Pitch Set Class_ (PCS, or pcs) may have multiple representations.

=== Textual

A PCS is, by definition, an unordered set of PC, even if, in practice, by convention, we always present them textually ordered, in ascending order.

Let's take the PCS [0, 4, 7], C, E and G. Formally the textual representations below are all equal.

image::_0_4_7_set_repr.png[_0_4_7_set_repr]

Example for C,E,G :  `[0,4,7]`

=== Vector

It is a binary representation of a pcs.

Example for [0, 4, 7]  (C major):  `[*1*,0,0,0,*1*,0,0,*1*,0,0,0,0]`  (ordered list of binary values) :

image:047_vector.png[]

This vector, of dimension _n_, is constructed by placing stem:[1] at the position corresponding to each pitch class present in the pcs studied, and stem:[0] at the position of the others. By convention, the position corresponds to the pitch class name (which turns out to be very practical for algorithms).

A function

stem:[tt"toVector(A)" : P(Z_n) -> {0,1}^n] {nbsp} defined by :

// stem:[tt"toVector(A)" = \[v_0,v_1,...,v_(n-1)\] ] where stem:[v_i = f_A(i)]

stem:[tt"toVector(A)" = \[f_A(0), f_A(1),...,f_A(n-1)\] ]

where the characteristic function stem:[f_A : Z_n -> {0,1}]  is defined by :

stem:[f_A(e) = { (1  if e in A), (0  if e notin A) :}]

So, for _n = 12_, any pcs stem:[A] of stem:[P(Z_12)] corresponds a vector stem:[v] defined as follows:

stem:[v = \[f_A(bar 0), f_A(bar 1), f_A(bar 2) , f_A(bar 3) , f_A(bar 4) , f_A(bar 5) , f_A(bar 6) , f_A(bar 7) , f_A(bar 8) , f_A(bar 9)  , f_A(bar 10) , f_A(bar 11)\] ]


Example :

toVector (0, 4, 7]) stem:[ = \[ v_0, v_1, v_2 , v_3 , v_4 , v_5 , v_6 , v_7 , v_8 , v_9 , v_10 , v_11\] ]

where stem:[v_i="f"_"(0,4,7)"(bar i)], so we obtain vector stem:[\[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0\] ]

IMPORTANT: We can clearly see the use of the name of Pitch Class as an index. This dual role must be subject to caution.

Example of analysis of a musical fragment. The fragment framed below is characterized by the pitch classes set [0, 4, 7] (Do, Mi Sol).

image:047_fragment.png[]

=== Integer

Yes, we can represent, identify, any PCS by an integer.

From binary vector representation, we will do the sum of power of 2, where value is 1 into vector. This algorithm, known as _polynomial function_, which we will call, in the context of this project, _polynomial identifier : pid_.

stem:["pid" : {0,1}^12 -> N]  {nbsp} defined by :

stem:["pid("v")" = sum_(i=0)^(n-1) v_i 2^i ] {nbsp} so add powers of 2 where stem:[v_i] is non-zero.

[NOTE]
====
Since there exists a function (toVector) which gives the vector image of any PCS, we can also define function _pid_ with this domain of definition  stem:["pid" : P(Z_12) -> N]

====
Example for [0, 4, 7] :  `1 + 16 + 128` = `145`  (decimal value)

.Examples of Polynomial Identifier
|===
|_Power of 2_|1| 2| 4| 8| 16| 32| 64| 128| 252| 512| 1024| 2048| _pid_
|[0,4,7]|*1*|0|0|0|*1*|0|0|*1*|0|0|0|0|
|_pid_|*1*|0|0|0|*16*|0|0|*128*|0|0|0|0|*_145_*
||||||||||||||

|_pid_  |*1*|0|0|*8*|0|0|0|*128*|0|0|0|0|*_137_*
|===

Examples :

 pid('[]') = 0 (empty set)
 pid('[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]') = 4095 (chromatic set)
 pid('[1,3,5,7,9,11]') = 2730 (whole tone scale)

NOTE: As each pcs into the 4096 is unique, each of these pcs has a unique value by polynomial function.

=== Geometry

==== Linear

--

Polygon inscribed into circle denote the intervallic structure of the PCS.

Other example, a minor 7 and its intervallic structure (3, 4, 3, 2) :

image:minor7-circle-is.png[minor7-circle-is]

TIP: Sum of intervals into intervallic structure is always _n_. For pcs : [0, 4, 7] this is (4, 3, 3, 2)

==== Musaic

A musaic is, by default, based on a geometric structure od dimension stem:[(phi(n)) /2].

For _n_ = 12, stem:[(phi(12)) /2 = 2 ], therefore 2D structure.

Musaic is instance of a dual interval space <<DIS>>, as two-dimensional array of pitches where “rows” are separated by the same interval and the “columns” by an other but also same (non-zero) interval (regular interface).

By default, we take as intervals step the "generator prime forme" of _n_, these are those in the first half of the prime integers with n. For n=12 these are 1 and 5 from [`*1*, *5*, n-5, n-1`].

[NOTE]
====
Wy take prime form with n ?

Because, each of them being generator of a generator step value of n, they guarantee to traverse the structure in its entirety, while preserving characteristics specific to n (in particular the invariants).

[NOTE]
====
There are other types of representation, such as Tonnetz, Thor, ... DIS with one interval step not in prime...

Examples : DIS(y,x) where y is row interval and x is column interval. Violin is DIS(1,7), guitar in P4 Tuning is DIS(1,5), Tonnetz is DIS(4, 7), etc.
====

// NOTE: Instrument in DIS(x,y) are in _regular interface_ family.

=== Together

All PCS representations are interchangeable by bijective connection.

== PCS Identity

Any ordered PCS (in normal form) is unique, but it is not a sufficient quality to sort them.

=== Order relation

It would be useful to be able to sort the pcs among themselves. To do this, we need to define a total order relation that verifies:

// stem:[ ∀ x, y ∈ P(E), ( "id"(x) ≤ "id"(y) and "id"(y) ≤ "id"(x) ) => x = y ]

//see syntax https://asciimath.org/
stem:[ AA x, y in P(E), ( "id"(x) <= "id"(y) and "id"(y) <= "id"(x) ) => x = y ]

In others all, if two PCS have same identity value, then we are dealing with the same PCS.

Question is : How to represent the identity relationship (id function)?

=== State
By definition, a PCS is a collection of PC. Type is not atomic, and may have some algorithmic efficiency problem, so we prefer a scalar identity.

=== Integer

To implement order relation, we use integer representation, to go through the order of natural integer.

==== Polynomial function

Polynomial function (_pid_) is a good candidate for sorting the PCS among themselves.

However, there remains a bias.

Examples with some pairs of pcs (pcs1 and pcs2), let's compare pid(pcs1) and pid(pcs2) to determine if pcs1 "is less than" pcs2 :

[%header]
.Example problem when compare identity with Polynomial Identifier
|===
|pcs1| pcs2| pid(pcs1) | pid(pcs2)| pcs1 < pcs2
| [ ]| [0]| _0_ | _1_ | **_true_**
|[0,4,7]| [1,5,8]| _145_ | _290_ | **_true_**
|[0,3,7]| [2,6,11]| _137_ | _2116_ | **_true_**
|[0,11] | [0,3,7] | _2049_ |_137_ | **_false_** (???)
 #_waiting true_#
|===

In the first line, we admitted that a pcs with a smaller cardinal than another pcs will be considered smaller than the latter. But this is contradicted by the last line, counterintuitive.

We admit that when two PCS are compared, the one with the smaller cardinality will always be considered inferior to the other, which can be defined by :

stem:[forall A, B in P(Z_n), |A| < |B| => A  < B]


==== Augmented Polynomial function

To take into account the cardinal in the general order relation that we are looking for, we introduce, independently of `pid` , a function stem:[w] : stem:[ P(Z_12) -> N ] {nbsp} defined by :

stem:[w(A) = m cdot |A| ]

In order to give significant weight to _w_ function, independently of _pid_, we take as the value of _m_, the multiplicative coefficient of the cardinal of the argument, a value greater than the upper limit of the domain of

TODO

definition of the coefficients of the polynomial P1, that is to say a value beyond the upper limit of [0..n-1], 2n being the first candidate. As for the cardinal of an element e of the set of parts of (Z/12Z), it is calculated by summing the values ​​ei of its vector representation, which gives:

The first valuefootnote:[the last is 2^12^-1], outside _pid_ domain, is `2^n^`

So, augmented polynomial function, which takes into account the cardinal, is  :  `_pid_ + 2^12^ * _cardinal_`



[%header]
.Example Compare with Augmented Polynomial Identifier
|===
|pcs1| pcs2| augPid(pcs1) | augPid(pcs2)| pcs1 < pcs1
| [ ]| [0]| _0_ | _4097_ | **_true_**
|[0,4,7]| [1,5,8]| _12433_ | _12578_ | **_true_**
|[0,3,7]| [2,6,11]| _12425_ | _14404_ | **_true_**
|[0,11] | [0,3,7] | _10241_ |_12425_ | **_true_** (ok)
|===

NOTE: In MusaicBox code, Augmented Polynomial Identifier is called _id_, and _pid_ is kept because is commonly used.

== Equivalence relation

Example of _proposition_ : "_To be a major triad_"

There are only 12 pcs, among the 4096 pcs, where this proposition is true.

[%header]
.Different representations of _major triad_
|===
|structure name| intervals | clock | musaic
| Major triad | major third then perfect fifth then perfect forth |specific inscribed polygon image:major-triad-polygone.png[major-triad-polygone]|specific motif image:major-triad-motif.png[major triad motif]
|===

Such proposition can take form of an _equivalence relation_ : _R_ = "_to share same structure_"

Some characteristics of _R_ :

* symmetric : stem:[∀ x, y ∈ P(E), x\ R\ y => y\ R\ x ]

* reflexive : stem:[∀ x ∈ P(E), x\ R\ x ]

* transitive : stem:[∀ x, y, z ∈ P(E), (x\ R\ y and y\ R\ z) => x\ R\ z ]

=== Orbit
Orbit is a set where all of its elements (pcs) are connected by the same equivalence relation.footnote:[see _setoid_ or _bishop set_]

Example : Orbit cyclic of major triad as `{ C,E,G }` is a set with equivalence relations "_having same structure of major triad_". This set is composed of 12 elements (`{ C, E, G }, { Cb, F, Ab }, ..., { B, D#, F# }`)

If we organize the 4096 pcs set into subsets with equivalence relation "_having same structure (of inscribed polygon)_", we obtain 352 types of polygonsfootnote:[and not 4096/12, because some pcs have less than 12 transposed - limited transposition] therefore 352 subsets (orbits) forming a partition of 4096 pcs set.

|===

Set of all these sets is known as `_P(E)_` (*power set*), and `cardinal(_P(E)_) = 2^n^ = *4096*`, cardinality ordered by line 12 of Pascal triangle.

// More formally, orbits are the result of the action of a group (cyclic, affine, dihedral, ..., musaic) on Z/nZ.

// By example : A4 (440 hz) and their lower and upper octaves share same characteristic : "having a frequency related to be a multiple of 2 of 440 Hz"
//

Pour partitionner l'ensemble des 4096 PCS,

En musique, il est généralement admis que nous pouvons changer la hauteur d'une oeuvre sans en changer fondamentalement sa nature. Dans la musique tonale, cette action est appelée "changement de tonalité".

Exemple : petite mélodie en 2 tonalités

On peut avoir 12 versions de cette mélodie (dans les 12 tonalités). L'ensemble de ces 12 versions est

Equivalence relation : "Having same prime form"

En identifiant n'importe quel son à une meme classe de hauteur (octave), modulo _n_, nous pouvons réduire tout extrait musical à un ensemble classes de hauteur.

It is about gathering all the elements sharing the same characteristic, in the same set called *equivalence orbit*, or *X orbit*, or *orbit* if equivalence context is clear.

TIP: An orbit is a set which can be empty (contains empty pcs) or contain all elements. For a given equivalence relation, an element belongs to only one orbit. Orbits, as a result of a group action, form  a partition of the set on which it acts (4096 PCS).

=== Octave/Enharmonic equivalence

Reduce to 12 pitches class and its 4096 PCS combinaisons (2^12^).

*Trivial group* has *4096* orbits, each orbit has max only one pcs (cardinal = 1)

=== Intervallic structure equivalence up to shift

This is form a cyclic group (group action on Z12).

All pcs of a given orbit share *same intervallic structure up to circular shift*, *obtained by transposition*.

In other words, PCS in clock representation having the *same inscribed polygon*.

Cyclic group has *352* orbits.footnote:[352 > 4096 / 12, because somme pcs are there cardinal cyclic orbit smaller than 12 (pcs in *limited transposition*)]

=== Dihedral equivalence

In this group, all PCs of a given orbit share the same interval structure of itself or its *inverse*.

Dihedral group has *224* orbits.

=== Affine equivalence

In this group, any pcs of a given orbit share with others pcs into this orbit, same intervallic structure of itself or this inverse or this transformed by *multiplication by 5 or 7 and their inverse*.

Affine group has *156* orbits.

=== Musaic equivalence

In this group, any pcs of a given orbit are in affine equivalence with itself or *affine complement*.

Musaic group has *88* orbits.

== Prime Form

A quality that allows, without ambiguity, to designate a representative among the elements of an orbit.

To put it simply, it is the *smallest element of an orbit*.

TIP: Can be represented by a function PrimeForm : EquivalenceRelation x pcs -> pcs (from an equivalence relation and a pcs given we obtain one and oly one pcs representative of equivalence relation orbit.
 +
Given R, an equivalence relation, and pcs1, pcs2 (two pcs), if PrimeForm(R, pcs1) == PrimeForm(R, pcs2), then pcs1 and pcs2 belong to the same R equivalence orbit.

=== What Prime Form is

Given an equivalence relation orbit (of pcs), there will always be a unique pcs _smaller_ than others into same orbit (thanks to the order relation).

Originally <<Forte>>, prime denotes a pcs in normal form and "most packed on the left (0)"

<<Rahn>> John Rahn proposes a more rational approach, based on vector representation of a pcs (and its image function in an integer result of polynomial function)

=== What Prime Form is not

Prime form is a "technical" characteristic of one element into an orbit, *without musical resonance*.

In absolute terms, any pcs into an orbit can be a representative of their orbit. By convention, we select the _minimal element_

=== Modal prime form

It is a pcs of cyclic orbit that, if possible, highlights its symmetry (else is cyclic prime form).

Example on pcs : [2, 3, 5, 7, 8] :
