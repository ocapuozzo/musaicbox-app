Musaicbox application is intended to be a POC for main concepts defined and illustrated on https://88musaics.org[88musaics.org] site, plus others (modes, scales, chords...). The implementation chosen for this application are detailed, and some concepts from Musical Set Theory are discussed.

== Introduction

The idea behind this application is to offer the user a UI/UX to concretely manipulate abstract concepts, highlight relationship (morphism) between logic spatial and sound structures (_Pitch Class Set_) .

We hope that user will make use of this tool in his composition and instrumental practice activities.footnote:[The only sound that will be produced will be the one generated by the user on his instrument :)]

=== For which audience ?

Musician eager to add to his source of inspiration a muse of a scientific nature, based on idea of reducing any combination of sounds to a set of pitch classes, called _pitch class set_ (PCS).footnote:[provided that they accept the postulate of the decomposition of an octave into 12 "equal parts".]

=== Use Cases

4 entries (four main pages)

* PCS page (with undo/redo.footnote:redo[redo:Back to the future only possible if the past has not been updated])
====
Useful from one PCS, explore modes, possible chords and other PCS in geometrical transformation relationship (with animation), Forte number, invariant class, and more....

== PCS

=== Abstraction

PCS is abstraction, a _pitches class set_ where a pitch class refer to all pitches related to each other by octave and/or enharmonic equivalence.footnote:[see Allen Forte, John Rahn...]

=== Enumeration

With set of 12 elements `E` = `{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}`

Is there 2^12 = *4096 pcs*, from empty set `{}` to ful set `{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}` passing by all possible ordered pcs configurations as `{0}`, `{1}`, ..., `{0,4,7}`, `{1,5,7}`,... , etc

Enumeration via line 12 of Pascal triangle

|===

Set of all these sets is known as `_P(E)_` (*power set*), and cardinal(_P(E)_) = 2^n = *4096*, ordered by PCS cardinality by line 12 of Pascal triangle.

== PCS Representations

A _Pitch Set Class_ (PCS, or pcs) may have multiple representations.

=== Set

Example for C,E,G :  `{0,4,7}` or `[0,4,7]` (from musical set theory)

It is customary to represent pitches class into a PCS in an ordered manner, called _Normal Form_, from smallest to largest. For example: [0, 4, 7] not [4, 0, 7]

=== Vector

Example for C,E,G :  `[*1*,0,0,0,*1*,0,0,*1*,0,0,0,0]`  (12 values)

Note : can be also vector of boolean values : `[*true*,false,false,false,*true*,false,false,*true*,false,false,false,false]`

=== Integer

From vector representation, we sum of power of 2, where value is 1 (or true) into vector (algorithm called _polynomial function_)

Example for {C,E,G} :  `1 + 16 + 128` = `145`  (decimal value)

.Example Polynomial Identifier ([0,4,7])
|===
|_Power of 2_|1| 2| 4| 8| 16| 32| 64| 128| 252| 512| 1024| 2048| _pid_
|_pcs_|*1*|0|0|0|*1*|0|0|*1*|0|0|0|0|
|_pid_|*1*|0|0|0|*16*|0|0|*128*|0|0|0|0|*_145_*
|===

Examples :

 pid('[]') = 0 (empty set)
 pid('[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]') = 4095 (chromatic set)
 pid('[1,3,5,7,9,11]') = 2730 (whole tone scale)

NOTE: As each pcs into the 4096 is unique, each of these pcs has a unique value by polynomial function. We call this value _pid_ for polynomial identifier.

=== Geometry
Example with [0,4,7]

==== Linear

==== DIS : Musaic, Tonnetz and more

More generally, a matrix regular representation is instance of a _Dual Interval Space_ (<<DIS>>), a two-dimensional array of pitches where “rows” are separated by the same interval and the “columns” by one other but also same (non-zero) interval.

Examples : DIS(y,x) where y is row interval and x is column interval. Violin is DIS(1,7), guitar in P4 Tuning is DIS(1,5), Tonnetz is DIS(4, 7), etc.

NOTE: Instrument in DIS(x,y) are in _regular interface_ family.

=== Together

All PCS representations are interchangeable by bijective connection.

Example : Integer to PCS, PCS to Integer, Integer to Vector etc.

== PCS Identity

Any ordered PCS (in normal form) is unique, but it is not a sufficient quality to sort them.

=== Order relation

It would be useful to be able to sort the pcs among themselves. To do this, we need to define a total order relation that verifies: ∀ x, y ∈ P(E), (id(x) ≤ id(y) and id(y) ≤ id(x)) => x = y (same)

=== State
By definition, a PCS is a collection of PC. Type is not atomic, and may have some algorithmic efficiency problem, so we prefer a scalar identity.

To implement order relation, we use integer representation, to go through the order of natural of integer.

=== Integer

==== Polynomial function

Polynomial function is a good candidate for sorting the PCS among themselves.

However, there remains a bias.

Examples :

.Example Compare with Polynomial Identifier
|===
|pcs1| pcs2| pid(pcs1) | pid(pcs2)| pcs1 < pcs2
| [ ]| [0]| 0 | 1 | **true**
|[0,4,7]| [1,5,8]| 145 | 290 | **true**
|[0,3,7]| [2,6,11]| 137 | 2116 | **true**
|[0,11] | [0,3,7] | 2049 |137 | **false** (???)
 **_waiting true_**
|===

In the first line, we admitted that a piece with a smaller cardinal than another piece will be considered smaller than the latter. But this is contradicted by the last line.

==== Augmented Polynomial function

In order to solve the inconsistency of the polynomial function for sort pcs lists, we increase this function by another value that takes into account the cardinality of the set. The first value, outside _pid_ domain, is 2^n * cardinal

So, augmented polynomial function is  : _pid_ + 2^12 * cardinal

.Example Compare with Augmented Polynomial Identifier
|===
|pcs1| pcs2| augPid(pcs1) | augPid(pcs2)| pcs1 < pcs1
| [ ]| [0]| 0 | 4097 | **true**
|[0,4,7]| [1,5,8]| 12433 | 12578 | **true**
|[0,3,7]| [2,6,11]| 12425 | 14404 | **true**
|[0,11] | [0,3,7] | 10241 |12425 | **true** (ok)
|===

NOTE: In Musaicbox code, Augmented Polynomial Identifier is called _id_, and _pid_ is kept because is commonly used.

=== Orbit
Orbit is a set where all elements (pcs) share the same equivalence property.

Example : Orbit cyclic of major chord `{ C,E,G }` characterised by interval structure  `IS:(4,3,5)`  is composed of 12 elements (`{ C, E, G }, { C#, E#, G# }, ..., { B, D#, F# }`)

More formally, orbits are the result of the action of a group (cyclic, affine, dihedral, ..., musaic) on Z/nZ.

== Equivalence relations

It is about gathering all the elements sharing the same characteristic, in the same set called *equivalence orbit*, or *X orbit*, or *orbit* if equivalence context is clear.

TIP: An orbit can be empty (contains empty pcs) or contain all elements. For a given equivalence relation, an element belongs to only one orbit. Orbits, as result of action of a group, partition the resulting data of this action.

=== Octave/Enharmonic equivalence

Reduce to 12 pitches class and its 4096 PCS combinaisons (2^12).

*Trivial group* has *4096* orbits, each orbit has max only one pcs (cardinal = 1)

=== Intervallic structure equivalence up to shift

This is form a cyclic group (group action on Z12).

All pcs of a given orbit share *same intervallic structure up to circular shift*, *obtained by transposition*.

In other words, PCS in clock representation having the *same inscribed polygon*.

Cyclic group has *352* orbits.footnote:[352 > 4096 / 12, because somme pcs are there cardinal cyclic orbit smaller than 12 (pcs in *limited transposition*)]

=== Dihedral equivalence

In this group, all PCs of a given orbit share the same interval structure of itself or its *inverse*.

Dihedral group has *224* orbits.

=== Affine equivalence

In this group, any pcs of a given orbit share with others pcs into this orbit, same intervallic structure of itself or this inverse or this transformed by *multiplication by 5 or 7 and their inverse*.

Affine group has *156* orbits.

=== Musaic equivalence

In this group, any pcs of a given orbit are in affine equivalence with itself or *affine complement*.

Musaic group has *88* orbits.

== Prime Form

A quality that allows, without ambiguity, to designate a representative among the elements of an orbit.

To put it simply, it is the *smallest element of an orbit*.

TIP: Can be represented by a function PrimeForm : EquivalenceRelation x pcs -> pcs (from an equivalence relation and a pcs given we obtain one and oly one pcs representative of equivalence relation orbit.
 +
Given R, an equivalence relation, and pcs1, pcs2 (two pcs), if PrimeForm(R, pcs1) == PrimeForm(R, pcs2), then pcs1 and pcs2 belong to the same R equivalence orbit.

=== What Prime Form is

Given an equivalence relation orbit (of pcs), there will always be a unique pcs _smaller_ than others into same orbit (thanks to the order relation).

Originally <<Forte>>, prime denotes a pcs in normal form and "most packed on the left (0)"

<<Rahn>> John Rahn proposes a more rational approach, based on vector representation of a pcs (and its image function in an integer result of polynomial function)

=== What Prime Form is not

Prime form is a "technical" characteristic of one element into an orbit, *without musical resonance*.

In absolute terms, any pcs into an orbit can be a representative of their orbit. By convention, we select the _minimal element_

=== Modal prime form

It is a pcs of cyclic orbit that, if possible, highlights its symmetry (else is cyclic prime form).

Example on pcs : [2, 3, 5, 7, 8] :
