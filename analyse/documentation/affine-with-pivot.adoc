== Revisited basic operations

(with pivot parameter for better basic operations)

As they stand, the generally accepted basic operations of musical set theory pose a logic problem that we raise here.



=== What's wrong with basic operations

Let us take the inversion operation (M11) as an example, but the problem raised here also applies to the transformations M5 and M7.

In the literature on post-tonal analysis, inversion operation can be found expressed in two forms which we will here call _inverseA_ and _inverseB_:

- stem:["inverseA"(Pcs) = { (n - x) mod n | x ∈ Pcs }] // basic version <<Forte>>

- stem:["inverseB"(Pcs) = { (n - 1) * x mod n | x ∈ Pcs }] // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_(music)[multiplicative version M11]

Example : C Major scale `[0 2 4 5 7 9 11]`

* _inverseA_(`[0 2 4 5 7 9 11]`) :

`0` -> `12 - 0` -> `#0#`

`2` -> `12 - 2` -> `#10#`

`4` -> `12 - 4` -> `#8#`

`5` -> `12 - 5` -> `#7#`

`7` -> `12 - 7` -> `#5#`

`9` -> `12 - 3` -> `#3#`

`11` -> `12 - 11` -> `#1#`

This gives : _inverseA_(`[0 2 4 5 7 9 11]`) -> `[#0 1 3 5 7 8 10#]`


* _inverseB_(`[0 2 4 5 7 9 11]`) :

`0` -> `11 x 0` -> `#0#`

`2` -> `11 x 2` -> 22 mod 12 -> `#10#`

`4` -> `11 x 4` -> 44 mod 12 -> `#8#`

`5` -> `11 x 5` -> 55 mod 12 -> `#7#`

`7` -> `11 x 7` -> 77 mod 12 -> `#5#`

`9` -> `11 x 3` -> 33 mod 12 -> `#3#`

`11` -> `11 x 11` -> 121 mod 12 -> `#1#`

This gives : _inverseB_(`[0 2 4 5 7 9 11]`) -> `[#0 1 3 5 7 8 10#]`

In fact, from a modulo n point of view, the functions _inverseA_ and _inverseB_ are the same. Proof.

Inverse operation transform CMajor into III degree of Ab Major, its VIb Major.

Now that we have seen how the PCS Do Diatonic Major behaves, let's take C#/Db Diatonic Major: `[0 1 3 5 6 8 10]`


* The inverse of C# Major, _inverse_(`[0 1 3 5 6 8 10]`) :

`0` -> `12 - 0` -> `#0#`

`1` -> `12 - 1` -> `#11#`

`3` -> `12 - 3` -> `#9#`

`5` -> `12 - 5` -> `#7#`

`6` -> `12 - 6` -> `#6#`

`8` -> `12 - 8` -> `#4#`

`10` -> `12 - 10` -> `#2#`

_inverse_(`[0 1 3 5 6 8 10]`)  -> `[#0 2 4 6 7 9 11#]`

image::DbMajor-M11-noPivot.png[DbMajor-M11]

#⚠# *Oh!*, how comes the treatment of inversion for a C#/Db Major *differs* from that of a C Major?

The expected correct answer of Inverse(`[0 1 3 5 6 8 10]`)  should have been `[#1 2 4 6 8 9 11#]`, III degree of A Major (the VIb Major of Db Major) and not `[0 2 4 6 7 9 11]`.

Other example, with a _Limited Transposition_ scale : _C Dim7_

image::CDim7-infos.png[CDim7-infos]

As you might expect, a diminished seventh chord is *very strongly symmetrical*. Observe its stabilizers, there are 16 of them and 4 are in T0 (highlighted in yellow in the screenshot above) : `#M1-T0#` of course, and  `#M5-T0#`, `#M7-T0#` and `#M11-T0#`.

Let's summarize the different transformation operations of two diminished seventh chords: CDim7 [.nowrap]#(`[0 3 6 9]`)# and C#Dim7 [.nowrap]#(`[1 4 7 10]`)#.

Obviously [2 5 8 11] is an intruder! business logic is not good. But then why is he here???

=== The "fixed zero problem"

The basic operations of musical set theory, which are the standard in the field, have a peculiarity: *they are always centered on _0_ (zero)footnote:[if _n_ is even, fixed points are _0_ and _n/2_]* , thus defining it as a fixed point we call the *_"fixed zero problem"_*.

The bad result we observed comes from the fact that the algorithms confuse index and pitch-class name, both being expressed by integers (a very useful confusion, by the way).

Calculations performed directly with these values lead to a falsely controlled side effect.

Example : `[1 4 7 10] x 11 = [11 44 70 110] modulo 12 = [11 8 5 2] => #[2 5 8 11]#`

As any musician would expect, the main characteristics of a PCS *should be insensitive to the transposition step* : the main characteristics of a PCS remain unchanged compared to those of the same PCS transposed by a _k-step_.

Indeed, the D-Major PCS share the same structural characteristics as any Major PCS, but we have noted that, in their basic form, the transformation operations, other than transposition, do not respect this constancy across all Major PCS.

[#Fixed-zero-problem]
====
[.text-center]
*_"Fixed zero problem"_*.

Generally speaking, the "fixed zero" has been identified as a problem by the Musical Set Theory, particularly in tonal system, and several solutions have been proposed.

* "_Babbitt and Perle develop "moveable-DO" systems. The zero residue is used to label the *first pitch-class* of the most significant row-form in any specific musical context_". <<LEWIN>>. We will see, with Db Major, that this is not a good solution. However, the idea is correct from the point of consistency, but should not be imposed but proposed as a default value.
* David Lewin proposes defining the LABEL function, which define a pitch-class reference for inversion, associates with a GIS (<<LEWIN>>, page 31).
* Later, David Lewin "frees" the LABEL function using a parameterized inversion operator _I^u,v^_, an inversion around an axis (interval _(u, v)_, or around a pitch-class _u_ if _u_ = _v_, then denoted by _I^u^_. <<LEWIN-1977a>> <<LEWIN-1980>>. Only deals with the case of inversion.
* Harald Fripertinger define in <<Fripertinger>> an _operator inversion, from Z to Z, with respect to r_  as [.nowrap]#_I~r~(i) = r − (z − r) = **2r - i**_#. So, when _r = 0_,  _I(i) = -i_. The parameter pitch-class reference only deals with operator inversion, although quart-circle and quint-circle transformations are defined in the same paper.

====


[#understand-fixed-point-algorithm]
=== Idea of solution

We are looking for a solution that allows to maintain the structural consistency of PCSs across different transformations, including inversion and transformation by cycles of fifths and fourths.

The David Lewin's operator (_I^u^_), and Harald Fripertinger inversion operator (_I~r~_) partially addresses this problem, but are reserved to the inversion.

We propose to generalize this solution to the extended general affine function seen previously by adding a new parameter to designate the reference fixed point of transformation.

We start from the observation that the points fixed by the transformation operations depend essentially on _n_. For _n_ = 12, these fixed points are represented by this figure :

.Template of transformations (n = 12)
image::fixed-indexes-n12.png[fixed-indexes-n12]

In its basic form of the affine function _ax + k_, the first term is always fixed by _0_, whatever _x_. Zero is the guaranteed fixed point, whatever _n_. An inventory is necessary.

|===


The axis of symmetry passing through zero, or six, denotes the canonical-axis of symmetry.

We decide to refer to this *canonical axis passing through zero*, in order to carry out the affine operations.

Note that, when _n_ is odd, axis passing through zero doesn't through any other pitch-class number. This is why we will only retain zero from now on.

Without calling into question the arithmetic based on pitch-class names, a general solution would be to align the PCS in question, via one of its pitch-classes, with the zero pitch-class before the transformation (M5, M7 or M11).

More precisely, this conceptually requires three operations, this is the price to pay for good consistency:

. Transpose, by a step ok _-p_, the PCS to make one of its PCs coincide with zero
. Apply the requested affine transformation (_ax + k_)
. perform an inverse transposition (_p_)

Some examples of inversion :

Example1 C-sharp Dim7 inversion : `M11-T0` on `[1 4 7 10]`

. `[1 4 7 10]` transpose with `p = -1` => `[0{nbsp}3{nbsp}6{nbsp}9]`
.  `[0 3 6 9]` x 11 modulo 12 => `[0{nbsp}3{nbsp}6{nbsp}9]`
. `[0 3 6 9]` transpose with `p = 1` => `#[1{nbsp}4{nbsp}7{nbsp}10]#`

Example2 D Major scale inversion : `M11-T0` on  `[1{nbsp}2{nbsp}4{nbsp}6{nbsp}7{nbsp}9{nbsp}11]`

. `[1{nbsp}2{nbsp}4{nbsp}6{nbsp}7{nbsp}9{nbsp}11]` transpose with `p = -2` => `[0{nbsp}2{nbsp}4{nbsp}5{nbsp}7{nbsp}9{nbsp}11]`
. `[0{nbsp}2{nbsp}4{nbsp}5{nbsp}7{nbsp}9{nbsp}11]` x 11 modulo 12 =>
`[{nbsp}1{nbsp}3{nbsp}5{nbsp}7{nbsp}8{nbsp}10]`

. `[0{nbsp}1{nbsp}3{nbsp}5{nbsp}7{nbsp}8{nbsp}10]` transpose with `p = 2` => `#[0{nbsp}2{nbsp}3{nbsp}5{nbsp}7{nbsp}9{nbsp}10]#`

// use instead [.nowrap]

This solution is correct for all affine operations, but raises another problem: How to determine the value of _p_ ?
//as a transformation at the origin?

More possibilities:

A. *Choosing the "smallest PC"*.
 +
This choice is the same as first pitch-class of PCS in normal order. This is technically correct, but it is not always the right one: It works in the case of C# dim7, but not on D Major, [.nowrap]#[1 2 4 6 7 9 11]#, because its first and minimum pitch-class is 1 (C#), the seventh of the scale, and not the root of D major.

B. *Any PC from chromatic circle*
 +
"_There are twelve ways of inverting the total pc chromatic into itself, and any one of these twelve inversions may assume priority in a given musical context._" <<LEWIN-1977a>>.
 +
But this choice does not guarantee the consistency of transformation operations: Take a pitch-class that are not part of the pcs to be transformed cause a side effect. Such a pitch-class pollutes the pcs to be transformed during the transformation. See <<_whats_wrong_with_basic_operations>> when zero in not a pitch-class of the given pcs.

C.  *Any PC belonging to PCS to be transformed*
 +
This ensures that the transformation will be based on a pitch-class of the relevant PCS (acting as a "fixed zero").
 +
This solution is compatible with the idea of the solution, leaving to the author the choice of the reference pitch-class, among _m_ choices, _m_ being the cardinal of the pcs concerned by the transformation (we will apply solution A to define a default value)

It seems clear that solution C prevails. The pivot _p_ must be chosen from the PCS pitch-classes.

[#design-affine-pivot]
=== Affine operation with pivot

A solution to resolve mismatch basic operations is to add a parameter _p_ (pivot) to Extended Special Affine Operation.

The p-value consists, for a given PCS, of selecting a pitch-class that:

- Acts as a fixed point in affine operations (not necessarily "zero" or the first pitch-class)

- Belongs to the pitch-class set under study, expected the empty set.

We have seen that when we want to control the fixed point of a transformation operation of a PCS, a series of three operations is required: M1-T-p, [C]Ma-Tk and M1-Tp. We call this operation _"AffinePivot"_, a right action.

=== AffinePivot reduced

We are now preparing to establish a condensed version of the function.

stem:["AffinePivot"_(c,p,a,k)(A) := M_1T_p(A) @ C_cM_aT_k(A) @ M_1T_-p(A)]

// Recall : Each extended affine function stem:[C_cM_aT_k] we can denote stem:[(c,a, k)], or stem:[(a, k)] when c=false, for the sake of simplification.

The extended affine composition function, that define one single function from composition of two functions, stem:[@],  is stem:[(c,a,k) @ (c',a',k') = (c oplus c', aa', ak' + k)]

We will use this affine reduction to reduce the composition of 3 functions, stem:[M_1T_p(A) @ C_cM_aT_k(A) @ M_1T_-p(A)], to a single one.

*  stem:[(false, 1, p) @ (c, a, k) @ (false, 1, -p)]
* = stem:[(false, 1, p) @ (c oplus false, a, -ap + k)]
* = stem:[(false, 1, p) @ (c, a, -ap + k)] // c ⊕ false = c
* = stem:[(false oplus c, a, -ap + k + p)]
* = stem:[(c, a, -ap + k + p)]
* = #stem:[(c, a, p(1 - a) + k)]#  <= solution

TIP: Unsurprisingly, only the transposition step is affected. +
We will call this simplified function: *{startsb}C]Ma~p~Tk* +

*_C_*, for complement, is optional. We will see that *_p_* can also be, provided that a default value is applied by a deterministic algorithm.

// a * (x - pivot) + pivot + t // 1 mut 1 sous 2 add

We can now define the operation that acts on PCS.

[IMPORTANT]
====


Although the affinePivot function `CM~p~aTk` or `M~p~aTk`, has replaced the usual affine function `CMaTk` or `MaTk`, it should not be lost in sight that `[C]M~p~aTk` it is only a contraction of a composition of three basic affine functions:
[.nowrap]#`M1-Tp ∘ [C]Ma-Tk ∘ M1-T-p`# or [.nowrap]#`M1-T~p~([C]Ma-Tk(M1-T-p(pcs)))`#
as explained here <<design-affine-pivot>>.

====
////

=== Default pivot value

For compatibility with the usual affine function, as well as for practical reasons, we define the concept of default pivot value.

[#default-p-value-logic]
====
[.text-center]
--
*Default pivot value when AffinePivot act on a PCS*

The default p-value is the first pitch-class of the PCS or pitch-class zero if the PCS is empty set.

stem:[p = {(a | a in A, if A != emptyset), (0, if A = emptyset) :}]

By correlation, any pitch-class set in prime form has the default p-value equals to zero.
--
====

With the default pivot-value defined, we can simplify the writing of the affine transformation `Ma~p~Tk` as `MaTk` when `Ma~p~Tk` acts on a PCS whose first pitch-class is equal to _p_.

Examples:

- (CMaj -> Fmin) `M11~0~T0([0 4 7])` =  `M11T0([0 4 7])` = `[0 5 8]`, pivot=0 and it is the first pitch-class

- (Fmaj -> Bbmin) `M11~5~T0([0 5 9])` =  `[1 5 10]`, pivot=5 is NOT the first pitch-class and must be specified.

- (FMaj/5th -> Cmin) `M11~0~T0([0 5 9])` = `M11T0([0 5 9])` =  `[0 3 7]`

- (C#dim7 -> C#dmin7) `M11~1~T0([1 4 7 10])` = `M11T0([1 4 7 10])` = `[1 4 7 10]`, pivot=1 and it is the first pitch-class

- (Db Major inversion) `M11~2~T0([1 2 4 6 7 9 11])` = `[1 2 4 6 8 9 11]`, The pivot must be specified, because the root is not the first pitch-class of the pcs.

// - stem:[(35, -10(5 + 1) + (1-5) + 15 + 2)]
// - stem:[(11, 1)] // modulo 12


If we assume that the pitch-class set, in normal order, represents a scale, _p_ designates the degree from which the `Ma~p~Tk` transformation will be applied.Not specifying _p_ in the affine MaTk function triggers the default pivot value assignment logic (<<default-p-value-logic>>.


[#_free_axis_of_symmetry]
=== Free axis of symmetry

We have seen that any affine transformation, based on the pivot value, is guaranteed to operate around an axis passing through the pitch-class-pivot, in complete coherence.

The question is: Can we maintain this consistency while being free to select another axis of symmetry than the one passing through the pivot value?The answer is YES, and we will see how.

First, let's take stock of the different axes of symmetry of a circle with a homogeneous distribution of pitch-class numbers.

|===
^|n = 7 ^| n = 5 ^| n = 8 ^| n = 12

|image:pcs-emptyset-n7.png[]
|image:pcs-emptyset-n5.png[]

|image:pcs-emptyset-n12.png[]

|===

We see that there are two ways to divide such a circle in two:

A. Median axis, passing *through* a pitch-class number

B. Intercalary axis, passing *between* two pitch-class numbers.

.Two symmetry axis types (n=8)
image::axis-symmetry-n8.png[]

Note that when n is odd, there is only one type of axis that is both intercalary and median.

To select an axis of symmetry, assign an appropriate value to _k_.

The axis of symmetry around which affine operations are applied actually passes through the midpoint of the segment represented by the two pitch-class numbers: _p_ and _p+k_, i.e: stem:[(p+k-p)/2], so stem:[k/2] in absolute value, we must add the value of _p_, hence axis through by stem:[p + k/2]


Examples of media and inter axis at stem:[p + k/2] :

Let _s_ be the pitch-class number through which the axis of symmetry crosses.

* stem:[ s = p + k/2] {nbsp} (when _k_=_0_, axis passes through _p_)


Depending on the needs, we can then determine each of the variables in this equation as a function of the other two, from this equation {nbsp}stem:[p +k/2 - s = 0]

// k ?
// * stem:[ 2S -2p -k = 0]
// * stem:[ k = 2S -2p]
* stem:[ k = 2(s-p)]

// p ?
//
// * stem:[ 2S -2p -k = 0]
// * stem:[ -2p -k = -2S]
// * stem:[ -2p  = k-2S]
// * stem:[ p  = (k-2S) / -2]
* stem:[ p  = s - k/ 2]


==== Summary

*The axis of symmetry is defined by the line segment it crosses at its midpoint. This line segment is defined by _p_ and _k_ by the pair _p, p + k_*.

In the example below, starting from _p = 2_, the step *_k = -3_* defines the line segment (_p, p + k_) by  _(2, -1)_, or (2,11) (modulo 12), and thus determines the axis of symmetry passing between (2, 11), or (0,1) , (3,10), (4,9), (5,8), (6,7).

`M11~2~T-3([256])` = `M11~5~T3([256])` = `M11~6~T1([256])` -> `[7811]`

k=0 is a special case, where line segment (_p,p_) distance is zero.

//
// === Conclusion
//
// * After observing the so-called "fixed zero problem", we were led to introduce a new parameter to the affine function acting on PCS, to improve the consistency of affine transformation operations such as inversion (M11) and transformation by cycle of fifths and fourths (M5 and M7).
//
// * The concept of a default value for the pivot has been introduced, allowing the parameterized affine function to substitute for the usual affine function. This allows us to still benefit from the advantages of group action (construction of orbits and stabilizers).
