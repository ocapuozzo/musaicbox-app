This document presents the main concepts illustrated on the 88musaics.org site, plus others (concept of modes and scales). The implementation chosen for this application are detailed, and certain concepts from Musial Set Theory are discussed.

== Introduction

Timbre, expression, duration, function... Everything that makes music touch us is not part of this study.

Nous cherchons simplement ici à identifier des liens potentiels entre structures musicales élémentaires (PCS)

=== For which audience ?

== PCS

=== Abstraction

Abstraction is a description of a reality.

The person who abstracts, reduces reality, or what he perceives as reality, into something smaller.

=== Orbit
Orbit is, finally, another term to describe an abstraction.
Elements of orbit share same characteristics of orbit.
Example : Orbit cyclic of major chord as `{ C, E, G }` is composed of 12 elements (`{ C, E, G }, { C#, E#, G# }, ..., { B, D#, F# }`)

== Representation

=== Set
=== Vector
=== Integer
=== Geometry

==== Circle
==== DIS
===== Tonetz, Musaic and more

=== Together

== Equivalence relations

This is a link that brings together different elements under one same roof, same orbit, same abstraction.


=== Octave equivalence

Reduce to 12 pitch classes and its 4096 PCS (2^12)

=== Intervallic structure equivalence

Reduce to 352 orbits


=== Dihedral equivalence

=== Affine equivalence

=== Musaic equivalence
