# MusaicBoxApp

Application Angular TS/JS is a demonstration implement of [88 Musaics](https://88Musaics.org) concepts.
Illustrates how geometry can highlight relationships between PCS.

- Bidirectional UI interaction: in clock and matrix representations

- Geometrical transformations 2D/3D of Musaic/PCS

- Simple music notation representation with [https://abcjs.net/](https://abcjs.net/)

- Some PCS features of Musical Set Theory presented

- Group Theory : Group builder & Group action UI (trivial, dihedral, affine, ...)

May be use as

- Helper compositional tool
- Application example of Group Theory (Zx Affine Group). Develop with group theory concepts and implemented by permutation operations (inside a vector).
